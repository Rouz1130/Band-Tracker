# Band Tracker

#### Site allows tracking which bands have played at what venues

#### _Created 09.28.2016.

#### By _**Rouz Majlessi**_

## Description

This site was made to fulfill the **Week four Epicodus Friday independent project requirement for the C# block**.  Project outline:

Write a program to track bands and the venues where they've played concerts. Make a Venue class and a Band class.

+ Build full CRUD functionality for Venues. Create, Read (show all, show single), Update, Delete.
+ Allow a user to create Bands that have played at a Venue. Don't worry about building out updating or deleting for bands.
+ There is a many-to-many relationship between bands and concert venues, so a venue can host many bands, and a band can play at many venues. Create a join table to store these relationships.
+ When a user is viewing a single concert venue, list out all of the bands that have played at that venue so far and allow them to add a band to that venue. Create a method to get the bands who have played at a venue, and use a join statement in it.
+ When a user is viewing a single Band, list out all of the Venues that have hosted that band and allow them to add a Venue to that Band. Use a join statement in this method too.

###### Requirements
For this code review, use the following names for your databases:

+ Production database: band_tracker
+ Development database: band_tracker_test
+ Resource names will be venues and bands
+ Include .sql files holding the schema for both your band_tracker and band_tracker_test databases (see instructions in the Migrating databases with SSMS lesson) . In your README, include the details of your database names and tables as a back up (see the example below from a To Do application):

```Sql

CREATE DATABASE bandtracker;
GO
USE bandtracker;

-- Table 'bands'
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bands;

CREATE TABLE bands (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  name VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Table 'venues'
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS venues;

CREATE TABLE venues (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  name VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Table 'bands_venues'
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bands_venues;

CREATE TABLE bands_venues (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  band_id INTEGER NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  venue_id INTEGER NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
-- Foreign Keys
-- ---

ALTER TABLE bands_venues ADD FOREIGN KEY (band_id) REFERENCES bands (id);
ALTER TABLE bands_venues ADD FOREIGN KEY (venue_id) REFERENCES venues (id);
GO

CREATE DATABASE bandtracker_tests;
GO
USE bandtracker_tests;

-- Table 'bands'
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bands;

CREATE TABLE bands (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  name VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Table 'venues'
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS venues;

CREATE TABLE venues (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  name VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Table 'bands_venues'
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bands_venues;

CREATE TABLE bands_venues (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
  band_id INTEGER NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  venue_id INTEGER NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
-- Foreign Keys
-- ---

ALTER TABLE bands_venues ADD FOREIGN KEY (band_id) REFERENCES bands (id);
ALTER TABLE bands_venues ADD FOREIGN KEY (venue_id) REFERENCES venues (id);


-- Test Data
-- ---

-- INSERT INTO bands (name) VALUES ('');
-- INSERT INTO venues (name) VALUES('');
-- INSERT INTO bands_venues (band_id,venue_id) VALUES ('','');

```
###### Objectives
Here are the objectives that will be used to review your code:

+ Do the database table and column names follow proper naming conventions?
+ Do you have thorough test coverage?
+ Are all tests passing?
+ Did you write the test methods and make them pass before starting on routes for each class?
+ Does your Venue class have all CRUD methods implemented in your app? That includes: Create, Read (all and singular) Update and Delete (all and singular).
+ Are you able to view all the bands that have played at a single venue, as well as all the venues that have hosted a particular band?
+ Is the many-to-many relationship set up correctly in the database?
+ Are the commands on how to set up the database in the README? Did you include the .sql files?
+ Is the project in a polished, portfolio-quality state?
+ Does the project demonstrate all of this week's concepts? If prompted, are you able to discuss your with an instructor using correct terminology?

###### Previous Objectives
And then, make sure to follow all the requirements from last week too.

+ Was Razor syntax used on view pages where appropriate?
+ Is your logic easy to understand?
+ Did you use descriptive variable names?
+ Does your code have proper indentation and spacing?
+ Did you include a README with a description of the program, setup instructions, a copyright, a license, and your name?
+ Is the project tracked in Git, and did you regularly make commits with clear messages that finish the phrase "This commit willâ€¦"?
